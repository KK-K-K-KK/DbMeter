## What is this?

This is a dB meter app that can detect the surrounding noise level.

Being exposed to noise level of 80dB or greater, could damage hearing.

Let's protect ourselves and live healthier, happier!


## Motivation

This work is an demo to practice iOS app development with using the microphone.
